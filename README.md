# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Essay Autograder

## Project Description
The Natural Language Processing (NLP) Essay Autograder is a system designed to automatically evaluate and score essays based on their quality. The input is an essay text, and the output is a numerical score ranging from 1 to 6, which reflects the essay's overall quality. The system uses NLP techniques to analyze various factors, such as grammar, structure, coherence, vocabulary, and content relevance, to generate an accurate and objective score. This tool can assist educators in providing quick, consistent feedback on student writing.

### Analysis
| Metric                        | Value               |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Optimal Hyperparameters**    | `{'C': 5, 'kernel': 'rbf'}` |
| **Evaluation (5-fold CV) Accuracy** | 0.572             |
| **Training Accuracy**          | 0.993               |
| **Testing Accuracy**           | 0.555               |

The training accuracy is extremely high, which means that the model is almost certainly not underfitted. Looking at the evaluation accuracy and the testing accuracy, it can be seen that since they are extremely close, that the model was properly fit. In other words, the 5-fold cross validation accuracy is meant to represent what the testing accuracy would be. Since it is so close to the actual testing accuracy, this indicates that the model canâ€™t be fitted any further.

### RNN Analysis 
From observing the resulting evaluation metrics for each class, it was determined that the accuracy is most negatively impacted by scoring classes (5 & 6). This was due to a combination of our training/testing splits, as well as the data used to train the model. The dataset used did not have a large quantity essay representations for higher grading criteria; therefore, this negatively impacted the model's ability to train to these ranges. 

## CNN (Myles)
Training Accuracy: 0.985 <br>
Evaluation (5-fold CV) Accuracy: 0.573 <br>
Testing Accuracy: 0.5288 <br>

**Overview:**
The Bag of Words pre-processing technique is used to convert text into tokenized form before training the SVM model. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to select the best model configuration using a 5-fold cross-validation approach. The final scores, evaluated with accuracy as the performance metric:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22d1afa4-ba49-4780-b091-81714973e4d6)

**Training Accuracy:**
This metric reflects the model's performance on the data it was trained on. A high training accuracy suggests that the model is able to learn and correctly classify most of the patterns in the training dataset.
Indicator of Model Learning: If training accuracy is too low, it means the model is not capturing patterns effectively, which may indicate underfitting.
Risk of Overfitting: If training accuracy is excessively high compared to evaluation and testing accuracy, it may mean the model has memorized the training data instead of generalizing, leading to poor real-world performance.
The training accuracy is 0.985, which is very high. This suggests that the model has learned well from the training data, but it is important to compare this with evaluation and testing accuracy to ensure it is not overfitting.

**Evaluation Accuracy (5-Fold Cross-Validation):**
Evaluation accuracy is calculated using a validation dataset or through cross-validation techniques. In a 5-fold CV, the dataset is split into five subsets, and the model is trained on four subsets while the remaining subset is used for validation. This process is repeated five times, and the average accuracy is reported.
Generalization Check: Evaluation accuracy gives an estimate of how well the model is expected to perform on unseen data. It acts as a proxy for the test set during training.
Overfitting Detection: A large gap between training and evaluation accuracy indicates overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but struggles on validation data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: During model optimization, evaluation accuracy helps determine the best set of hyperparameters without leaking information from the test set.
Evaluation accuracy is 0.573, which is much lower than the training accuracy. This suggests the model generalizes less effectively than it performs on the training data, it does not necessarily indicate overfitting as long as evaluation and testing accuracies are aligned.

**Testing Accuracy:**
Testing accuracy is the final metric that measures how well the model performs on completely unseen data. It represents real-world performance since the test dataset is not used during model training or evaluation. Model Deployment Readiness: Testing accuracy reflects how the model is expected to perform in practical scenarios.

The model demonstrates strong learning ability with a high training accuracy of 0.985, indicating it effectively captures patterns in the training data. However, the evaluation accuracy of 0.573 and testing accuracy of 0.550 suggest moderate generalization to unseen data. The close alignment between evaluation and testing accuracies confirms that the cross-validation process reliably estimated the model's real-world performance. While there is no significant overfitting or underfitting, the noticeable gap between training and evaluation/testing accuracies suggests the model may overfit slightly to the training data. To improve, the model could benefit from regularization, refined feature engineering, or more diverse training data to better capture broader patterns. Despite this, the alignment of evaluation and testing scores provides confidence that the model is well-calibrated for deployment. Further optimization could enhance performance, but the current metrics indicate a functional and reliable model for practical use.

## Fully-Connected NN

**Overview:**
<br>
Fully-connected neural networks can be used to identify and learn complex decision spaces given that the data from which the network learns is properly represented. To perform essay scoring with a fully-connected neural network, 150-500 word essays were first tokenized utilizing a BERT tokenizer. Tokenized text was then passed to the "bert-base-uncased" pretrained model to generate embeddings for the text. From these embeddings, the most relevant for usage in the case of a fully-connected neural network is the CLS token, a vector which captures longer-term relationships between words within text. These tokens were then used as feature vectors on which a fully-connected, 3 layer neural network utilizing sigmoid activation functions was trained for 500 epochs, cross-validated to perform hyper-parameter tuning, and tested.

**Training:**
<br>
After generating feature vectors, the 3 layer FCNN model was trained with batch sizes of 64 on an 80% split of the data over 500 epochs. An Adam optimizer was used, with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. The hidden layer consisted of 128 units, and a dropout of 0.5 was used after the initial layer to attempt to reduce overfitting. 

Over the 500 epoch for which the model, accuracy increased logistically to ~65% and loss decreased logisitically, as can be seen in the below learning curves:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bb65094-d71b-4053-a51f-97f0f99a9247)

Model performance per class can be observed in the form of a confusion table below:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c7918cc-eb3b-488e-bf4c-6ed24a08251e)

It is apparent from this confusion matrix that after training the model classifies the majority of the training data correctly, and if an essay is scored incorrectly it is usually only incorrect by 1 unit of scoring. In other words, for the ~35% of the training data that the trained FCNN misclassifies, the majority of these misclassifications are by the smallest unit of misclassification possible. <br>

Below are the per class accuracies, precisions, recalls, and F1 scores:

| Class    | Accuracy | Precision | Recall   | F1 Score |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Class 0  | 0.945212 | 0.564069  | 0.908511 | 0.696007     |
| Class 1  | 0.837544 | 0.725223  | 0.655228 | 0.688451     |
| Class 2  | 0.752497 | 0.689435  | 0.571254 | 0.624805     |
| Class 3  | 0.824765 | 0.620277  | 0.625397 | 0.622826     |
| Class 4  | 0.945946 | 0.511278  | 0.887728 | 0.648855     |
| Class 5  | 0.997209 | 0.756410  | 1.000000 | 0.861314     |

As can be seen, per class accuracy is high after training, with scores (classes) falling in the middle of the distribution having the highest inaccuracies. This indicates that trained model is most accurate when identifying scores that are either very good or very poor, but has more trouble descerning between more average scores. It is worth noting that recall is higher than precision for scores, indicating that the models overclassify training data as one of these scores.

Ultimately, final accuracy on the training set was computed to be: 0.6515863689776733 <br>

**Validation:**
<br>
5-fold cross-validation was performed on models to ensure that the model parameters that best balances qualities such as high accuracy, low overfitting, low underfitting, and reasonable performance were found. 
<br>
<br>
,b>Some notes on hyper-parameter tuning:<b> 
<br>
    - Decreasing learning rate successfully completely eliminated overfitting, but also reduced overall accuracy to less than 50% and caused issues with performance <br>
    - Increasing number of hidden units improves accuracy but decreases performance significantly; however, decreasing from 256 to 128 hidden units had only margin effects on fitting and accuracy <br>
    - Decreases in batch size by a factor of 2 improved accuracy, but decreases in performance were so significant that such batch sizes were unreasonable to use <br>
    - Increasing epochs to beyond 500 can improve training performance significantly (up to ~80% overall accuracy), but these accuracy increases are the result of overfitting validation set accuracy remains in the 50-60% range <br>

The most reasonable hyper-parameters for our model were found to be 500 epochs on a model with 128 hidden units in the middle layer, using batch sizes of 64 and a learning rate of 0.0001.
<br>
Found below are the cross-validation results given these hyper-parameters: 
<br>
<img width="596" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db4c86fc-25ed-4fec-8c00-23bccd8c0f4f"> <br>

**Testing:**
<br>
Testing was performed on a 20% of the original dataset using the hyper-parameters found most reasonable during the validation stage. 
<br>
The overall accuracy of the model on the testing data was: 0.5323149236192715
<br>
This accuracy is ~10% lower than that the model's accuracy on the testing data, indicating that some overfitting on the training data is still present with the given hyper-parameters. It is also possible that some patterns exist in the testing data could exist the training data, but given that this accuracy is similar to that of the validation sets during cross-validation it is likely that this is not the case. <br>

Model performance per class on the testing data can be observed in the form of a confusion table below:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af3a68aa-fb6e-4dd8-abc6-d7a81c633c97) 

As with the training set, it is apparent that the largest single predicted value of any class is its actual label, however the aggregate of incorrect classifications significantly diminishes the accuracy. Additionally, as seen with the training data, the majority of misclassifications are by the smallest possible unit of misclassification.

Below are the per class accuracies, precisions, recalls, and F1 scores for the model on the testing data:

| Class    | Accuracy | Precision | Recall   | F1 Score |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|

The above data indicates that, while some patterns in the testing data remain similar to the training data, there is a general decrease in the individual accuracies for each classification. This could be attributable to new patterns in the data that the model has not encountered before in training or due to overfitting on training data. It is notable that have been significant decreases in both precision and recall, and subsequently a decreases in F1 scores for all classes. However, the same pattern of recall remaining larger than precision on the low and high scores remains the same as in testing, indicating that the model still tends to score many essays with one of these scores. <br>

**Conclusion:**
<br>
Lower accuracy of validation and testing sets compared trained data suggests that the model has a tendency to overfit. Given enough training data, more computational resources, and more representative feature vectors, it is possible that a 3 layer FCNN could increase its accuracy on testing sets and begin to accurately score essays in much the same way as a human graded would. Given the current conditions however, a FCNN only seems to be adequately useful at identifying a range of 3/6 scores in which an essay should be graded.

Bert

Bert stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, and is used in a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Bert is bidirectional, meaning it reads text from left to right simultaneously. It is trained to predict a masked word or sentence from a given block of text. This training allows Bert to find connections and establish context in a given block of text. This is useful for text-classification, which is our goal for this project. Bert itself doesnâ€™t process raw text, the input must first be tokenized. This is simply the process of transforming the text into numbers that Bert can interpret. Bert expects an id, attention mask, and token type ids. The id is the numerical representation of a word or subword, the attention mask represents which ids are from an input and which are padding, and the token type ids are a mask to differentiate between different sequences in an input, such as a question and an answer.Â 

Throughout the development of this project, many different layers were connected to the output of Bert in order to act as classification layers. These layers take the context learned by Bert, and are trained to correctly classify the score of an essay. The results from a single linear layer, trained for 500 epochs with a cross entropy loss function, is shown below.Â

Similar results were obtained when using combinations of LSTM layers, sigmoid layers, linear layers. Notably, the model has a much higher accuracy rate for more common classifications, while it does much worse of classifications that arenâ€™t as common in the training data. This can be seen in the confusion matrix for testing, which shows the model did not predict a single 5 score essay correctly. This distribution of scores for the entire dataset is shown below.Â

In order to help improve the models performance on less frequent classifications, I tried changing the loss function. I created a vector of weights, where each weight corresponds to a class. The weight for each class is computed as Wi = NN Ci, where N is the number of samples, and Ci is the number of samples with target classification i. This gives a larger weight to classifications that occur less frequently. The following results were obtained from using this new loss function.Â

The new loss function raises the probability the model correctly predicts higher scores. However, it now predicts these classes at a very high rate, which is shown from its precision score of .09 for score 5. This means only 9% of all score 5 predictions are actually score 5. For this reason, the total accuracy of the model is significantly less than the one trained with a non-weighted cross entropy loss function.
